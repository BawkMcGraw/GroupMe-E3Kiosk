# GroupMe Bot Starter

This bot provides E3 2019 information to chat requests. Includes bot name, so it doesn't spam everytime you talk about e3.... hopefully. It lets you check times using the following commands:

* today
* tomorrow
* saturday
* sunday
* monday
* tuesday
* xbox or microsoft
* sony
* nintendo
* ea
* square enix
* bethesda

You must include its name in the request:

* E3 Info

I've already included this years schedule. The next thing to do is create a way it finds and pulls that information so I don't have to update the bot every year, or every day after a stream has passed and the video is now on youtube.
